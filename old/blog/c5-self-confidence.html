            <h3>Read or watch chapter 4 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:</h3>
            <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
            <p>They are very similar concepts. Both involve introspection and awareness of oneself. Mindfulness is a bit more stepping out of your body and your emotions and focusing on yourself, and self awareness is looking back at our emotions and seeing how they affect our body.</p>
            <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
            <p>I really enjoyed the body scan! It is something fairly similar to a technique I learnt in intermediate. The body scan however was over a longer period of time than I would typically focus for and on different, larger portions of the body. It was very relaxing and a great way of noting where I was holding the tension in my muscles. I find both these techniques super useful for relaxing the whole body, but I think I prefered being more aware of larger areas so I could actually see larger trends in what my body was doing.</p>
            <p>The journaling seems useful. And like something I will definitely try. I liked the various examples of starting points provided too. Especially “What I am feeling now is…”. It lends itself well to not judging previous events you might be more emotional about and instead talking about how you feel about those emotions in the moment.</p>
            <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
            <p>I think my favourite part was “..if emotions are simply what I experience in my body, then feeling angry becomes a lot like feeling pain in my shoulders after an extreme workout; both are just physiological experiences over which I have influence. I can soothe them. I can ignore them and go get some ice cream, knowing I will feel better in a few hours.”</p>
