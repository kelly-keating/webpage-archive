      <h2>List of things that I may add if they suit the page but that I will definitely experiment with anyway</h2>

      <h2>What is HTML, CSS, and the DOM?</h2>
      <p>You can think of the HTML as the script of a movie. It tells you all the things that are in the movie, all the dialogue and the characters that say it, but nothing about what the movie looks like.</p>
      <p>The CSS would then be the storyboard of the film. It tells you what each of the scenes should look like and how the characters should interact.</p>
      <p>The DOM perhaps would then be the final edit of the film. It's essentially the result of the script and storyboards (though there may have been some tweaks here and there to make it suit a theatre release). But editors can go into the individual scenes and shots and alter things, which results in a slightly different movie.</p>
      <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
      <p>Boxifying is essentially breaking down the design of a website into boxes. Each of those boxes might contain some text, an image, or perhaps more boxes. By dividing the page into these boxes it makes things easier to code and design.</p>
      <div id="box-model">
        <img src="../images/box-model.png" alt="Box Model" width="350" />
        <div id="box-text">
          <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
          <p>A box in the box model consists of four elements: the margin, the border, the padding, and the content it surrounds. These four come together to define the total box and its size, wih the content being elements on the webpage.</p>
