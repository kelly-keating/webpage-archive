      <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
      <p>To be honest, I didn't find this reading particularly revelatory. A lot of the concepts discussed in this chapter weren't necessarily new to me, but it was still interesting to read about them in such a straightforward manner. Especially when taking this idea of brain training and the studies looking at the physical effects this had on the brain. I do look forward to reading a bit further into this book.</p>
      <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
      <p>I really enjoyed this and found it not too difficult. It's something I practice not infrequently, but I like the idea of experimenting with it being a regimented, every night type thing. I found doing this really useful when doing university assignments. Sometimes you just felt so rushed and overwhemled that taking a minute or two to center yourself again was really useful. It meant I could often go back to working with a bit of a calmer mindset and was able to look at what I had left to do more clearly. Made the big tasks seem more managable.</p>
