            <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
            <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
            <p>I already have a potential buddy to join me in this. I know this technique was very useful for me when starting to go to the gym regularly, so I imagine it will be similarly useful in this.</p>
            <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
            <p>I like the idea of mindful walking when doing things such as goung to the restroom at work.</p>
            <p>“Do less than you can: the idea is to do less formal practice than you are capable of. For example, if you can sit in mindfulness for five minutes before it feels like a chore, then do not sit for five minutes—just do three or four minutes, perhaps a few times a day. The reason is to keep the practice from becoming a burden. If mindfulness practice feels like a chore, it’s not sustainable.”</p>
            <p>“Initially, we can make the game easy. For example, we can tell ourselves, “If I can sit for just five minutes, and I can maintain a solid attention on my breath for ten continuous breaths anytime during these five minutes, I win!” If you can beat the game at this difficulty setting, say, 90 percent of the time, you can increase the difficulty setting for more fun. Once again, the key is to create just enough difficulty to be challenging, but not enough to discourage you. One funny thing I discovered about playing this game is after I became quite good at it, the lowest difficulty setting became really fun. That setting for me is, “Just rest my mind for ten minutes, in an alert sort of way.” ”</p>
            <p>“initial access” and “consolidation.”</p>
