            <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>

            <p>HTML and CSS are static code, but JavaScript is dynamic. It can take inputs, whether it be from a user or time or a whole host of other things, and can react. This might be to change how the page looks, or having something like a drop-down menu that appears when you hit a button. HTML and CSS build the page, but JavaScript makes it work.</p>


            <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h3>

            <p>Control flow is basically the order in which functions and commands are called when a program runs. It also determines what section of the code is called during this time, perhaps when using 'if else' statements. Loops call a section of code multiple times until some condition is not met.</p>

            <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>

            <p>Due to an array's structure data can only be accessed by inputing a location (within the square brackets notation) such as <code>data = arr[0]</code> which will retrieve the first entry in the array. Objects comparitively, use a key:value notation so to get the data you have to use the corresponding key. Eg. for <code>var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", eyeColor:"blue"};</code> you can use dot notation <code>var name = person.firstName;</code> or the bracket notation <code>var surname = person["lastName"]</code> to access values within the object.</p>

            <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>

            <p>Functions take a bunch of instructions and make them into a seperate little bundle. It means that instead of having to write out the same thing every time you use it, you can instead call a function that is a smaller action within a large piece of code. Using smaller fnctions can make your code more readable too. Instead of trying to work out what's happening in a large block of code, you could call a function like 'findLarger()' that means you can instantly tell what that part of the code is doing instead of spending your time figuring out your code everytime.</p>
