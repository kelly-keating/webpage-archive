      <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
      <p>The main technique I tried Counterintuitive Tip #6: Give Yourself Less Time. I know that I can give myslf a whole afternoon and get nothing done. So this week I drew up a schedule of my time (a rather busy one this week) and worked out times when I would be able to give myself specific hours to work between. Even if I couldn't get whole tasks finished in this time I found it really useful for actually sitting down and doing something.</p>
      <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
      <p>I found the idea of the Pomodoro technique interesting. When I get into the groove of it, I find myself doing a version of this when coding. I allow myself that short period to do other things before focusing back on the task, but the time period, the 25 minutes, is much shorter than what I would usually spend focused. So perhaps I will try out this shorter period to see how it affects things.</p>
      <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
      <p>Apart from giving myself less time, I found another of the counterintuitive tips just as useful. Making it painful not to do. I had a couple of occasions this week where periods where I was supposed to be working were immediately followed by seeing other human beings. I told them what I was doing before meeting them, and so knew I would be questioned as to whether I had accomplished it upon meeting. It worked rather well.</p>
      <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
      <p>Well as I mentioned the Pomodoro technique holds interest. Having regimented times of working and not. Also investigating some of the later steps further. Quite by chance I have also read some of the book Better Than Before by Gretchen Rubin recently. She also talked about the idea of starting small. She started meditating for 2 minutes a day to get into the swing of it. I have been using this in my exercise routine but it would also be good for my coding. Another thing is tying activities to others, so it becomes natural to just follow through to the next when you might not choose to do it naturally. I think this and actually writing up my times for the week. That's my plan.</p>
