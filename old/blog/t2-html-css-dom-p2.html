      <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
      <p>By dividing the webpage into a grid of rows and columns elements can be kept aligned and ordered on the page. By dividing the page into 12 columns it makes it easy to divide into thirds, quarters, whatever is required. It also makes it easier to play with design ideas like that of the <a href="https://3.7designs.co/blog/2009/01/the-gutenburg-diagram-in-design/" target="_blank">Gutenberg Diagram</a>.</p>

      <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
      <p>Nowadays there is not just one way we see the internet, one screen, one size. There are all sorts of devices with different screen sizes, even between computers there can be a huge difference in resolution. By having webpages that can recognise what sort of device they are being shown on, content layout can be changed to suit smaller (or larger) screens and enable us to view pages with whatever device we use from tiny phone to huge desktop screens.</p>

      <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
      <p>Semantic structure gives web pages their basic structure. Elements such as headings and tables are some of these. They are standard tags that, while their appearance can be altered, are not defined purely by the user.</p>
