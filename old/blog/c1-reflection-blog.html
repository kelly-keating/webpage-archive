      <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
      <p>It's a great sort of environment. To see people working together to improve their learning is wonderful. Where everyone in the group wants to be there and improve themselves. I really enjoy this small group setting, where the tutors want to see you succeed as much as we do.</p>
      <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
      <p>It's all about what you put into it. And it's going to be fun.</p>
      <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
      <p>I think it will go great. I love being able to work with others, to be able to work collaboratively. I have always enjoyed being able to assist others when they need it (and get that little help with mine when I'm stuck), so while I know I can be shy at first, once I'm in there and doing the things it'll be a good time. It's something that I'm a bit nervous, just due to it being a totally new environment, but I know that as soon as we get into it I'll really enjoy it and get into it.</p>
      <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
      <p>No, I don't believe they have. I did a decent amount of research before I signed up so had a reasonable sort of picture of what to expect.</p>
      <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
      <p>Yes and yes.</p>
