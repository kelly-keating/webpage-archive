            <h1>The Meditation Process</h1>
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
            <p>I found this week rather challenging, doing the whole rebuild. Partially due to the amount of time it took me to familiarise myself with the skeleton framework. I'm still not sure I've got a handle on it! Being able to focus on what I was doing rather than whether I was going to achieve it was rather useful. It meant I actually spent less time trying to perfect my code (as much of my perfectionist side protested) and instead enjoyed what I was doing.</p>

            <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself?</h3>
            <p>It seems useful to some people. I don't know that meditation for extended periods could ever work for me, but I certainly enjoy and use some of the smaller processes.</p>

            <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
            <p>I like the idea of meditaion being cultivating your mind. I also loved the gym analogy. One thing I do like to do is to go to the gym (especially with others, but by myself too. So forgive some brief enthusiasm). When you try new exercises you're inevitably terrible, but being able to push past that bit of resistance or to keep trying while still being terrible is very rewarding. I like how easily attention training and focusing is compared to this, where even if you don't think you're very good, the fact that you're doing it means you're getting better (It's just like being at the gym!).</p>

            <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
            <p>“If you have to react (for example, you really have to scratch), try to take five breaths before reacting.” I liked this concept and am definitely going to be adding it to my repertoire.</p>

            <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
            <p>“The act of creating good intentions is itself a form of meditation.”</p>
            <p>Meditation is forming mental habits and “an attitude of self-directed kindness”</p>
            <p>The four main meditation postures: sitting, standing, walking (my favourite), and lying down.</p>
            <p>Sitting like a mountain.</p>
