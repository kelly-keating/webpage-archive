            <h1>Design to Web</h1>
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <h3>What is a responsive site? And why is responsiveness important?</h3>
            <p>Due to the number of different screen sizes and formats in the world today, there is no way you could design a single website to look good on all those devices. A responsive website has the ability to change and adapt to the size of the screen it is on so that it is always legible and looking good. If it couldn't do this, at best it would be unappealing to use on some devices, and at worst it makes the site unusable on those devices. Either way this doesn't encourage people to continue using your site.</p>

            <h3>What about mobile first design?</h3>
            <p>With mobile first design, instead of taking a design for a large webpage and attempting to shrink that design to make it fit on a mobile screen, you start by designing for the small mobile layout. This means you can focus on what elements are necessary for the page and how they should work together in the smaller space before moving to a larger design of the same elements. It means that you can start with what is necessary before moving up to larger screen sizes where you have more freedom to arrange the content and can add extra features or design on devices that can handle it, rather than starting there and struggling to pare it back.</p>

            <h3>What are frameworks?</h3>
            <p>Frameworks are pre-designed code that provide a generic basis for your own code. It allows you to focus on creating and designing your content rather than trying to work out how to structure your webpage. They can save a lot of time as you can create a lot of code off a solid base of the framework rather than having to define individual classes and their styles. And if you do want something different, your own code can overwrite the framework's.</p>
            <p>One of the real drawbacks I found from working with the skeleton framework however, was that because I didn't write it there were some parts of the code that I just didn't know. And it didn't accomodate a lot of what I wanted to do with the page. It provided a base to work from, sure, but I couldn't quite work out what that base was and how to change it. It meant I spent a long time trying to get a handle on the framework rather than being able to utilise it.</p>

            <h3>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h3>
            <p>A wireframe is like a blueprint of a webpage. It tells you where the important and functional parts of a webpage are located on it, typically using a line drawing. It enables us to build the structure of the website itself without worrying about any of the cosmetic designs that go over top.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="four columns"><img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Index - Desktop" width="80%"/></div>
              <div class="four columns"><img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Blog - Desktop" width="80%"/></div>
              <div class="four columns"><img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Index - Mobile" width="80%"/></div>
              <div class="four columns"><img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Blog - Mobile" width="80%"/></div>
            </div>

            <p>You can see in the wireframes above that i had a navigation bar up the top of the screen. But I couldn't work out how to extend the bar outside of the predetermined width from the framework!</p>
